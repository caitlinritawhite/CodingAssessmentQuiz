# Homework4

Welcome to my Coding Assessment!

This is a 5 question, multiple choice quiz on JavaScript. You have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. Each question is worth 1 point. If you answer a question wrong, the page will alert you that you have been penalized by 5 seconds of your time. If the time runs out before you finish the quiz - you will only be awarded points for the questions you have answered (correctly). If you complete all 5 questions before the time is up, the page will store your score. If you have the highest score, you will remain on the leader board until someone else matches or exceeds your high score.

Good luck!
